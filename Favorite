This is a list of favorite Leetcode problems, should review them more than one time:

Tag:
    Binary Search:
        475 Heaters, binary search return index where the target should be placed
        287 Find the Duplicate Number, think of array as linked list, runner technique
        162 Find Peak Element, very smart using binary search to reduce time complexity
       *34  Find First and Last Element in Sorted Array, binary search middle point
       *378 Kth Smallest Element in Sorted Matrix, using binary search in such a smart way

    DFS:

    BFS:
        199 Binary Tree Right Side View, wisely use DFS and level to traverse binary tree

    DP:

    Array:
