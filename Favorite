This is a list of favorite Leetcode problems, should review them more than one time:

Tag:
    Binary Search:
        475 Heaters, binary search return index where the target should be placed
        287 Find the Duplicate Number, think of array as linked list, runner technique
        162 Find Peak Element, very smart using binary search to reduce time complexity
       *34  Find First and Last Element in Sorted Array, binary search middle point
       *378 Kth Smallest Element in Sorted Matrix, using binary search in such a smart way

    DFS:
        98 Validate Binary Search Tree, iterative inorder traverse
        547 Friend Circles, union find

    BFS:
        199 Binary Tree Right Side View, wisely use DFS and level to traverse binary tree
        207 Course Schedule, topological sort
        542 01 Matrix, remember BFS is a good method to solve shortest path problem
        310 Minimum Height Tree
        785 Is Graph Bipartite, coloring map
        787 Cheapest Flights within K Stops
